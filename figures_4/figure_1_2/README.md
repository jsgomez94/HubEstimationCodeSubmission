## figure_S1

This folder contains the code to replicate figures 1 and 2 of the main paper. 


1. <code>002, 004</code>: files containing all the required packages and custome functions for the simulations. 

2. File <code>005_figures_1n2.R</code>: file that contains the calls for simulations, and creates figures 1,2. All outputs are saved in the files <code>006_fig1.R</code>, <code>006_fig2.R</code>.

## Instructions:

1. To perform the simulations and create plots, run the following command line: 

    - <code>Rscript 005_figures_1n2.R</code>

    Alternatively, open the file <code>005_figures_1n2.R</code> in RStudio with the working directory <code>./figures_4/figure_1_2/</code>, and run the entire script.
